There are several sources of principles, issues or factors to support or consider in designing a privacy-supportive system. These include the OECD guidelines and FTC (see also versions from the DHS and others) Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs). There are even location-specific sets include the CTIA guidelines (which are organized around a few principles). 

[ Mulligan and Doty](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rp834wf) present a list of ten factors, drawn from FIPPs, academic theories of privacy (including informational self-determination and contextual integrity) and industry experience.

* Appropriateness
* Minimization
* User Control
* Notice
* Consent
* Secondary Use
* Distribution
* Retention
* Transparency and Feedback
* Aggregation

For each of these factors, we've listed titles for potential privacy patterns that support privacy for that factor. (Some patterns may be listed for more than one factor.) Patterns may also be organized by layer/level (front-end/back-end/privacy policy) or even role (UI designer/developer/lawyer).

## Appropriateness ##
* ...
  * ''something process-oriented: user research, evaluating existing norms, etc.''

## Minimization ##
* [[Fuzzing]] / [[Location granuality]]
* Summarization

## User Control ##
* User privacy preferences (''GeoPriv'')
* Privacy by default

## Notice ##
* Asynchronous notice
* Ambient notice
* Privacy policy

## Consent ##
* Opt (''contra opt out vs. opt in'')

## Secondary use ##
* Data use preferences (''GeoPriv'')

## Distribution ##
* Distribution preferences (''GeoPriv'')

## Retention ##
* Trail/history anonymization
* Encrypting location data

## Transparency and Feedback ##
* Privacy dashboard
* Per-recipient and per-datum transparency (''How do others see me?'')

## Aggregation ##
* Trail/history anonymization
* k-anonymity
