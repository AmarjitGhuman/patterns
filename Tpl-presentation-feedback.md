* patterns
    * Alex: there are categories of software design patterns
		* is location one category?
		* anonymization might be one broad category

    * Don: how do you know the patterns are the effective ones?
		as a vocabulary, it's actually good to have even if the patterns are bad (anti-patterns) or be able to discuss when or why you should use X
		as opposed to just saying, "I think this is bad"
		
	Deirdre understands immediately when we mention Christopher Alexander
	
	Alex: several different ways to categorize this
		scoping down to location might just be artificially narrowing yourself, 
	
	Leslie: "an architecture program" the functions that a client would want for a building
		series of pages that describe what the client wants from various points of view
		
		once you have patterns that you can share, you can improve each particular one
			the client wants This, doesn't want This
			e.g. transparency at the bottom of a door to avoid opening a door into a child
			
		the "program" is broken down into particular patterns
