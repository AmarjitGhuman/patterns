## Patterns: schema.

It would be in line with modern web standards to ensure that the
patterns published on the website conform to web standards. Some of
these are mentioned below:

 * Search Schema support (see [[schema.org|http://schema.org/Thing]])
 Patterns published on the website **SHOULD** follow microformat
specifications 
 Probably a custom subset of *Thing::Article* would be something we
could look at. 

 * RSS/Atom feeds of new patterns
 Eventually it would be a good idea to expose feeds for patterns by
topics and/or category. 

 * Template for writing patterns
 We should decide on a underlying pattern template which can be used to
write new patterns. This might evolve over time.
