## Tools for communication and tracking

### Project Requirements

#### Website

 * source control for website source. 
 * dynamic web hosting and domain name for the website
 * Bugs and task tracking for the website

#### Patterns

 * collaboration tool for writing patterns
    * multiple authors (initially Nick and Mohit, but potentially others who are less technical)
    * preferably authoring in preferred formats (plain-text Markdown for Mohit, MediaWiki for Nick, web-based for Deirdre, etc.)
    * allow links between patterns and to principles / other pages
 * revision history for patterns
 * faceted and/or hierarchical organization for patterns
 * public sharing for patterns (privacypatterns website)
    * publicly-shared patterns should be separate from patterns currently being drafted
    * it should be fairly easy to publish a pattern from the collaborative writing tool once it's ready

#### Task tracking, meeting notes and misc items

 * Task tracking for the project
 * repository for meeting notes
 * repository for presentations, image resources and other media. 

#### Interviews

 * people to interview
