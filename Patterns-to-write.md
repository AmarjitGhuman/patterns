''List the title (and potentially brief description or informative links) of a possible pattern, even one you're not sure about, here, so that we can remember it and potentially write it up later.''

* '''Unlisted or unguessable URLs''' -- rather than requiring a log in, just make a long URL that isn't listed anywhere or shows up in search results; people can informally get privacy by sharing the URL only with some people, with the drawback that the URL can be forwarded around

* '''Summarization''' -- on the server side store just the processed conclusions/inferences/summaries of some data, rather than all the raw data itself

* '''Privacy / data usage activity stream''' -- the same way we get activity streams about our friends, why not see an activity stream of how other services are accessing and processing your data? (Also, could re-use/take advantage of standards and conventions around activity streams.)

** Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications "Apps You Use"] access log includes day-by-day logs of which information was accessed by which Facebook app

* '''Stripping invisible metadata''' -- Remove invisible and potentially sensitive metadata (like geolocation in EXIF) from uploaded user-generated content.
