_List the title (and potentially brief description or informative links) of a possible pattern, even one you're not sure about, here, so that we can remember it and potentially write it up later._

* [WRITTEN] **Unlisted or unguessable URLs** -- rather than requiring a log in, just make a long URL that isn't listed anywhere or shows up in search results; people can informally get privacy by sharing the URL only with some people, with the drawback that the URL can be forwarded around

* **Summarization** -- on the server side store just the processed conclusions/inferences/summaries of some data, rather than all the raw data itself

* **Privacy / data usage activity stream** -- the same way we get activity streams about our friends, why not see an activity stream of how other services are accessing and processing your data? (Also, could re-use/take advantage of standards and conventions around activity streams.)

  * Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications "Apps You Use"] access log includes day-by-day logs of which information was accessed by which Facebook app

* [WRITTEN] **Stripping invisible metadata** -- Remove invisible and potentially sensitive metadata (like geolocation in EXIF) from uploaded user-generated content.

  * See [https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/20156423-about-image-uploading-on-twitter Twitter image uploading]

* **Show examples of data** -- rather than abstract categories, show examples (pictures, addresses, specific sample pieces of data)

* **Privacy policy** -- whether it's a pattern or an anti-pattern, it's certainly a common practice for addressing Notice.

* **Usage notification** -- an application lets a user know why they're asking for location at the time that they're asking. See, for example, Lion's new `purpose` parameter, the Camera app on iPhone, maybe old versions of Google Gears.

* **Privacy Grids** For a service that shares information captured during usage, with different groups/applications, it is useful to represent the practices as a grid with one axis being "kind" of data and the other being "shared with". Eg. Foursquare privacy grid (https://foursquare.com/privacy/grid)
