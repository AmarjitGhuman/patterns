# Patterns and Anti-patterns

Author: @npdoty

One supporting point for using "patterns" as the output is that we can
also compare to "anti-patterns". I most often hear this with the
"password anti-pattern" but it's a pretty widely used term. I can't find
the link right now, but I think there was also a list of "dark patterns"
for violating privacy or user expectations.

It might be useful in giving example best practices to also show
examples of anti-pattern or bad practices; here's what you should avoid
and why. Of course in many cases this will be kind of hard to show --
many privacy anti-patterns are problems because of their invisibility --
but may occasionally be a great help.
